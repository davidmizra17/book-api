cd book-api
```

### Step 2: Install Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the official installation guide for your operating system:

- **[Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**

### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Make sure you're in the root directory of the cloned repository.

2. Build the Docker image and start the container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### Step 4: Access the API

Once the container is running, you can access the API at:

```plaintext
